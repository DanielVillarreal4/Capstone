# Capstone
First:
  Download NodeJS https://nodejs.org/en/
  Download VS Code https://code.visualstudio.com/
    Click the checkbox for all the installation features and install.
    
To view the frontend:
Clone the repository to a location. 
Go into the frontend folder. 
Right click on an empty place in the folder, and then click "Open with Code"

When VS Code opens, in the Terminal tab at the top. Open a new terminal. 
  First check if nodeJS is installed with the following command: node -v
  IF NodeJS wasn't installed, try restarting your PC, then check for nodejs again with the same command.
  Assuming nodeJS is installed, run the following command: npm install --save --legacy-peer-deps
  Hopefully no errors occur. 
Then to finally run the frontend, run the following command: npm run serve
